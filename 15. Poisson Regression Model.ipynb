    "### 14.2.1 Introduction to Count Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative data can be divided generally into two sub groups: continuous and discrete. Discrete data typically involves integers which cannot be made with greater precision, for example, the number of operations a patient has undergone cannot have divisible entities i.e. 2.8 operations makes no sense. However, continuous data can have non integers which can be increased in precision for example a volume of liquid could be recorded in litres, mililitres, millimillilitre and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Count data is a discrete data type which can only take non-negative integer values, for example {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. These integers should arise from counting and not ranking. Count data is common in health data, for example the number of readmissions to hospital a person has would be classed as count data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When count data is treated as a random variable where possible values represent the possible outcomes of say a future experiment, then count data can be modelled by the Poisson, binomial and negative binomial distributions. This section only focuses on using the Poisson distribution, however briefly to cover how the other two distribution can be used if we think of clinical trials as a dichotomised variable defined as success or fail then:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tBinomial distribution can be used to describe the count of successful trials achieved in a total number of trials, given a constant probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tNegative binomial distribution can be used to describe the count of successful trials until observing a defined number of failures, given a constant probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.2.2 Why can't we just use Ordinary Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main assumptions required for fitting an ordinary linear regression (OLR) is that the residual errors must follow a normal distribution. For this to be achieved with data from a skewed distribution, a transformation must be applied however with discrete data this can be very problematic (making the interpretation of the findings unfeasibly difficult) or impossible (for example, a high number of 0’s could prevent normality from being achieved). Another issue is that an OLR has the ability to create negative predicted values which would be theoretically impossible. For these reasons it is better to apply a method which actually reflects the natural distribution instead of trying to make the distribution reflect the method. This is why a Poisson regression is generally more suited to count data than OLR.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution was first published by Siméon Denis Poisson in 1838. Poisson was a French mathematician, engineer, and physicist, his name is one of 72 engraved on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The Poisson distribution is a skewed, discrete distribution restricted to non-negative numbers. The shape of the distribution is defined by the shape parameter $\\lambda$ which represents the average number of events in the given time interval. As $\\lambda$ increases the distribution looks more and more like the normal distribution. When $\\lambda$ is about 10 or greater, then a normal distribution is a good approximation. \n",

    "\n",
    "-\tThe probability of an event occurring is proportional to the length of the time period being examined. \n",

    "### 14.3.1 Brief Introduction to Poisson Regression\n",
    "Poisson generalised linear modelling is commonly known as Poisson regression but is sometimes referred to as a log-linear model. Poisson regression is the generalised linear model form of a regression analysis. It is fitted to data when the outcome is assumed to have a Poisson distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Poisson regression assumes the outcome variable has a Poisson distribution and uses a logarithm as the canonical link function. A link function acts as a bridge between a linear predictor and the mean of the distribution function of choice. The canonical link function is basically the “well-defined” link function and is derived from the exponential density function of the distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we want to model $\\mathbf{Y}$ using Poisson Regression so $\\mathbf{Y} \\sim P(\\mu)$ and let the mean $\\mu$ (and therefore the variance) depend on a vector of explanatory variables $\\mathbf{X}$. We will need to take the linear predictor $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{\\beta}$ and combine it with a link function ($g$) so that the left hand side of the predictor $\\mu$ is always non-negative. We include the link function like this:   \n",

    "\n",
    "$ ln(E[\\mathbf{Y} | \\mathbf{X}]) = ln(\\mu) = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{\\beta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\beta$ contains the regression coefficients. An element of $\\beta$ represents the expected change in the natural $log$ of the mean per unit change of one explanatory variable in $X$ (constraining the other elements to not change). \n",

    "If you wanted to find the expected value of the outcome variable $\\mathbf{Y}$ given $\\mathbf{X}$ then the equation looks like this:\n",
