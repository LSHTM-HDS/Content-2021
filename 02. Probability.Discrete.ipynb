    "### Uses of Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes Theorem has important and powerful applications in medical statistics. One common use, particularly relevant for us, is in the area of assessing the accuracy of screening tests and prognostic scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Screening tests are tests that attempt to identify people with a particular condition or disease of interest. Babies are often screened for cystic fibrosis at birth, for example. Sometimes, screening tests attempt to identify high risk people rather than those who already have the condition of interest. Cervical screening, for example, which is offered to all women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64 in the UK by the National Health Service, is a test to help prevent cancer. It doesn't look for existing cancer, but instead looks for certain viruses which can increase the subsequent risk of cancer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Screening tests can be based on one genetic marker, as in our example below, or many. Or they might incorporate information from other sources (e.g. biomarkers, family history of the disease). Screening tests typically result in a binary classification of \"positive\" or \"negative\". "

Of those who develop the cancer ($C$), 1 in 4 carry a genetic marker, $M$, whereas of those who don't develop the cancer, 1 in 10 carry $M$.  A newly born infant is tested for the genetic marker and is found to carry it. What is the probability that this infant will develop cancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first couple of sentences tell us that $P(C) = 0.1$, $P(M|C) = 0.25$  and $P(M | \\bar{C})=0.1.$ Our interest lies in $P(C|M)$. So we wish to reverse the conditioning. We can obtain this by applying Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "\n",

    "### The confusion matrix\n",

    "More generally, suppose we have a procedure that results in a binary classification (a binary prediction). This might be a screening test, which could be based on one or more genetic markers or biomarkers. It could be based on the output from a  prognostic risk score or a label derived from an algorithm. Whatever the procedure, suppose we end up with a binary classification: \"Positive\" or \"Negative\". In the health context, this terminology (positive/negative) might represent pairs such as: \"Diseased\" and \"Undiseased\"; \"Dead\" and \"Alive\" or \"Hospitalised\" and \"Not hospitalised\". We can contrast the binary classification with the (binary) true status. In the general discussion below, we will also use the terms positive and negative to denote the two possible true statuses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following table is often called a **confusion matrix**, or sometimes error matrix. The name confusion matrix stems from the fact that the matrix allows you to see whether the classification is *confusing* two classes.

In our discussion of the binomial distribution, we simply mean a Bernoulli trial, which is a statistical experiment which results in a binary outcome. So the trial in question could be whether or not a baby is a male; whether or not someone is alive in 30 days time; whether or not someone experiences a side effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, the word \"success\" can be confusing. We use the word success to denote having the event of interest. It does not imply that this is a good event. In fact, the event we are interested in, in health applications, is often a bad one. It might be diagnosis of cancer or death, in which case a success would refer to someone having cancer or dying. Conversely, if our study was looking at treatments for improving pregnancy rates, our event, and thus the definition of success, might be a couple becoming pregnant. So the word success, in this context, does not necessarily refer to a good event (although sometimes it does!).\n"

In our calculations, we will assume that the proportion of males at birth is 0.51 and that the gender of each birth is an independent event.\n",

    "How do we obtain the probability distribution for the random variable $X$ which records the number of successes in a sequence of $n$ trials?

    "*Assumptions*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for a variable to follow a binomial distribution, some \"structural\" things need to be true. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. There must be a fixed number of Bernoulli trials\n",
    "2. Each trial must result in a binary outcome (success or failure)\n",
    "3. The outcome we are interested in must be defined as the total number of successes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two key *statistical assumptions*, implied by our derivation above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Bernoulli trials must be *independent* of one another\n",
    "2. The probability of success must be the same across Bernoulli trials\n",
    "\n",
    "*Applications*\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are interested in a particular disease within a large population of $N$ individuals. If, in the population, $M$ is the number of individuals with the disease of interest, then the probability of \"success\" (i.e. an individual having the disease) is $\\pi = M/N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we take a random sample of $n$ individuals from the large population. We will use $X$ to be the random variable for the number of \"successes\" out of the $n$ individuals. Then we might be happy to assume that $X$ follows a Binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "- In order for the probability $\\pi$ to remain constant, if we took another sample of $n$ we would have to \"replace\" the original $n$ individuals, so there would be some small possibility of picking the same person twice. In practice, people are not sampled twice. But populations are usually so large that we can ignore this.\n",
    "- We also need to assume that individual outcomes (here, having the disease or not) are independent. There are many ways in which this could be violated. People within the same family have shared genetics, shared environments, etc. all of which might lead to outcomes that are more similar between family members than between individuals from different families. \n"

As the number of intervals we divide $T$ into increases, at most one event will occur in each interval, and so $X$ will equal the number of intervals in which an event occurs. Since the occurrence of events in each interval are assumed independent of each other, $X \\sim Bin(n,\\pi)$, where $n$ is the number of intervals and $\\pi$ is the probability of an event occurring in any given interval.\n",
