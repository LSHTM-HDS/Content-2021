    "\n",
    "It may be tempting to make causal inference from regression models such as Model 3, i.e. \"longer pregnancies **cause** an increase in birthweight\". However, this is far from straightforward. Based on the results presented above, it would be reasonable to say that \"birthweight increases with length of pregnancy\". However, it is much less reasonable to claim that higher birthweight is caused by longer pregnancies (based on these results alone), because there may be an unobserved third variable that is the \"real\" cause of both increased length of pregancy and birthweight. Causal statements require more than just the results of a statistical model to make them plausible; this is a topic that we return to in the next lesson. \n",

    "**Interpretation of the intercept**\n",

    "+ $\\hat{\\beta}_0=-88.52$. The interpretation is that the estimated mean birthweight for a child who was born after 0 gestastional days and whose mother's height is 0 inches is -88.52 ouces. Clearly this is an absurd value to estimate because no babies are born that quickly and no mothers are that short. If we wish to obtain a more reasonable intercept, we can use a technique called **centering**.  \n"
