    "Table 1 provides an example of the features of different investigation types. The overall topic is stroke in women. The table (taken from Hernan et al. 2019) provides an example research question, the features of data that would be required to answer it, and the types of analysis that could be used for investigations of three types: Description, Prediction and Causal inference.\n",
