    "# 17. The role of regression in different types of investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of this section of the notes, we considered different types of investigation that might be of interest within a health data science project. We grouped these investigations into three classes: descriptive, predictive and causal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having explored various types of regression modelling, we now revisit the idea of the underlying investigation and consider the role of the regression model in different types of investigation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We often use the same statistical tools to address research questions for investigations of different types. Regression is a key tool for analyses in all the types of investigation. In this short session we illustrate how the same regression model could be used in prediction and causal investigations, but that the output from the regression should be used and interpreted differently.\n"

    "We focus on a simple (fictitious) observational study involving three variables: two binary explanatory variables ‘maternal smoking status’ ($X_{1}$ = 1: smoker, $X_{1}$ = 0: non-smoker) and maternal socioeconomic status ($X_{2}$ = 1: low, $X_{2}$ = 0: high), and a continuous outcome ‘birth weight’ (measured in grams). The assumed relationships between the three variables are summarised in the causal diagram in the figure below.\n",

    "Suppose instead that the aim is to assess the causal effect of maternal smoking ($X_{1}$) on birth weight ($Y$). In the simple setting shown in the causal diagram above, maternal socioeconomic status ($X_{2}$) is the only confounder of the association between $X_{1}$ and $Y$. \n",

This is referred to as an ‘average causal effect’. The 95% confidence interval can be used to provide information about how precisely we believe we have estimated this causal effect. In this case, the 95% confidence interval excludes 0 and includes only negative numbers, running from -513 to -169.   \n",

    "After adjusting for maternal socioeconomic status, maternal smoking was associated with a lowering of 341 grams in mean birthweight. After adjusting for maternal smoking, low maternal socioeconomic status was associated with a lowering of 214 grams in mean birthweight. However, $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ in model (1) do not have the same type of interpretation. This  is due to the relationships between the three variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Interpreting $\\beta_2$*: According to the causal diagram above, maternal smoking status is on the causal pathway from socioeconomic status to birth weight. Hence the parameter $\\beta_2$ represents the effect of socioeconomic status on birth weight that does not go through smoking status - this is a ‘direct effect’ rather than a ‘total effect’. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Interpreting $\\beta_1$*: By contrast, $\\beta_{1}$ represents the total effect of smoking status on birth weight. We do not go into details about definitions of different types of effect. The aim here is simply to point out that the correct interpretation of the coefficients in the regression model in (1) depends on assumptions about the inter-relationships between the three variables, including how they are ordered in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some (or perhaps many) epidemiological investigations that involve exploration of risk factors, estimates of regression coefficients from multivariable models such as that in (1) (and versions with many more explanatory variables) are presented alongside one another in a table, together with confidence intervals and p-values. They may then be interpreted as though all coefficients had the same meaning, ignoring possible inter-relationships between the variables and temporal ordering. As we have seen from the above example, this could be misleading. This problem has been referred to in the literature the ‘Table 2 fallacy’, because the estimates of regression coefficients are often presented in ‘Table 2’ in a paper (where ‘Table 1’ is usually a table of descriptive statistics). See Westreich and Greenland (2013) for a description of the Table 2 fallacy. Bandoli et al. (2018) provide an example in the context of preeclampsia and preterm birth.\n"
