    "+ The estimated intercept, $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ is equal to -10.75. This is interpreted as: the estimated mean birthweight of a child born after 0 gestational days is -10.75oz. Since there are no observations with 0 gestational days in the study, this is an extrapolation based on the observed data and an assumption of linearity. Estimates based on extrapolation should be interpreted with caution and in this case, the results make little sense because a negative weight is estimated. Moreover, no child is born after 0 gestational days and so this intercept is of little interest. Later on in the lesson, we will discuss a technique called **centering** which is often used to make more interpretable intercepts. \n",
