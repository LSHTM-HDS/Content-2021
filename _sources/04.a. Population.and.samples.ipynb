    "In this session we will begin thinking about statistical inference. Loosely, this describes the process of using a sample of data to make statements about a wider population. There is more than one framework for statistical inference. The traditional and most widely used approach is termed the “classical” or frequentist, and this is the one pursued in this and the next few sessions. An important alternative, the Bayesian approach, is increasingly influential. You will meet Bayesian inference later in this module."
