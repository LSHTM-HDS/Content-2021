    "## 16.2 Estimating the effect of treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the kidney stones example the effect of treatment type on the outcome is confounded by stone size, because smaller stone size is associated both with an increased likelihood of getting lithotripsy rather than surgery, and with greater chance of a good outcome. In this situation we know that to discover the real ‘effect’ of treatment type on the outcome we have to control for stone size. But what exactly do we mean by the ‘treatment effect’? There are different ways of measuring the treatment effect and we could be interested in a marginal treatment effect or a conditional treatment effect.\n",

    "To define the treatment effect we introduce some new notation.\n",

    "### 16.2.1 Seeing’ versus ‘doing’\n",
    "\n",
    "To discuss what we mean by a treatment effect let’s first consider the difference between an observational study and a randomized controlled trial. The study of kidney stone treatment described above is observational, so we ‘see’ which treatment individuals in the study population received in the ‘real world’. By contrast, if we had instead performed a randomized trial to investigate the treatment effect we would intervene on the treatment to be assigned (through the randomization). Thus in an observational study we ‘see’ the treatment X, whereas in a randomized trial we ‘do’ the treatment X. A treatment effect is defined in terms of what the difference in the distribution of the outcome would have been under the two treatments. Suppose that instead of ‘seeing’ X in the kidney stones study we had instead been able to ‘do’ X. We can then imagine the hypothetical situations in which everyone in the study population had been given surgery, denoted do(X = 0), or in which everyone had been given lithotripsy, denoted do(X = 1). The ‘do’ notation was introduced by Pearl (1995). Accessible introductions to this concept are given in the books by Pearl, Glymour and Jewell (2016) and Pearl & Mackenzie (2018).\n",

    "This is referred to as the Average Causal Effect (ACE). It is a ‘marginal’ treatment effect because it is ‘marginalized’ or ‘averaged’ over the distribution of Z in the study population.

In a different study with a different distribution of Z the marginal treatment effect would be different.\n",

    "We can never observe the outcome Y under the hypothetical situations in which all individuals in the population of interest received treatment X = 0 and in which all individuals received treatment X = 1, because in reality each individual can only receive one treatment at a given time. However, a randomized trial mimics this scenario through randomization, which makes the groups of individuals in the two treatment groups comparable. In a randomized trial we ‘do’ X on two comparable groups of individuals and so the probabilities Pr(Y = 1|do(X = x)) (x = 0, 1) can be estimated directly from the data on Y and X because Pr(Y = 1|do(X = x)) = Pr(Y = 1|X = x) (x = 0, 1). In the observational study Pr(Y = 1|do(X = x)) $\\neq$  Pr(Y = 1|X = x) due to the confounding by Z.\n",

    "In the observational study in this example, Z is the only confounder, and therefore after conditioning on Z we have Pr(Y = 1|do(X = 1), Z = z) = Pr(Y = 1|X = 1, Z = z). This means that conditional treatment effect (conditional on Z) can be estimated from the observational data usingthe observed probabilities Pr(Y = 1|X = 1, Z = z), because after conditioning on Z there is no confounding of the association between X and Y.\n",

    "We have seen above how conditional treatment effects can be estimated from the observational data where there is confounding. Now let’s consider how we could estimate a marginal treatment effect, as defined in 1, 2 and 3.

Now let’s think about the term Pr(Z = z|do(X = 1)). It helps to look at the DAG in Figure 1 for this part. If we intervene on X, as implied by do(X = 1), then this has no impact on Z because Z comes before X, i.e. it is not downstream from X. It follows that Pr(Z = z|do(X = 1)) = Pr(Z = z). Using these results we can write the above expression as\n",

    "The probabilities Pr(Y = 1|X = 1, Z = z) and Pr(Z = z) can both be estimated from theobservational data and hence we can estimate the marginal treatment effects. This technique of expressing Pr(Y = 1|do(X = 1)) in terms of the conditional probabilities Pr(Y = 1|X = 1, Z = z) and Pr(Z = z) is called ‘standardization’. It is an example of the use of weighted averaging. Standardization is also referred to as ‘marginalizing’ or ‘averaging’ over Z and it has a long history of use in epidemiology (e.g. see Rothman, Greenland & Lash 2008).\n",
