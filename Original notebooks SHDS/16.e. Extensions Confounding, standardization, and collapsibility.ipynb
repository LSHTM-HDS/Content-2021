    "## 16.4 Collapsibility\n",

    "We expect the effect estimates for a treatment to change when we adjust for an important confounder. Conversely, when we adjust for a variable which is not a confounder, intuitively we do not expect the estimated treatment effect to change. However, it turns out that this intuition is only correct in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will look at a property of certain estimands which is called ‘collapsibility’. For this we consider a modified DAG as shown in Figure 2. Compared with the DAG in Figure 1 the arrow from Z to X has been removed, indicating an assumption that Z does not affect X. A situation such as this would arise if X is a randomized treatment in a randomized trial, for example.\n",

Unlike in the previous section, here there is no confounding by Z and so the marginal expectation can be written as E(Y |do(X = x)) = E(Y |X = x). That is, in this situation it is legitimate to estimate the marginal treatment effect without having to use standardization (and using standardization will give the same result).\n",

The regression of Y on X and Z provides an estimate of the conditional treatment effect E(Y |do(X = 1), Z = z) − E(Y |do(X = 0), Z = z) of 1.98, which is assumed by the model to be the same for Z = 0, 1 (and which we know is true because of how the data were simulated - you can check this in the practical using the simulated data by including an interaction term).\n",

In this example they are quite different in magnitude (comparing 5.44 with 9). The implication of this is that if we compare the coefficient for X in a logistic regression of Y on X with that from a logistic regression of Y on X and Z, a change in the coefficient (a log odds ratio) does not necessarily suggest that Z is a confounder. Due to the non-collapsibility of odds ratios, we expect the coefficient for X to change even when Z is not a confounder .\n",

    "### 16.4.3 Implications for randomised controlled trials\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding results have implications for randomised trials with binary outcomes when the treatment effect is quantified using an odds ratio. In RCTs, baseline covariates are sometimes adjusted for. Given the non-collapsibility of odds ratios, the odds ratio for the treatment effect will differ depending on what baseline covariates are adjusted for. This is potentially problematic, as it means that, all other things being equal, different trials may be estimating different quantities simply due to differences in the covariates which are being adjusted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the question of which treatment effect we should be interested in estimating. The marginal treatment effect is (arguably) the relevant quantity for making policy decisions, while conditional effects are more relevant for answering how effective a treatment will be for a particular individual (on the basis of the values of their covariates). Marginal quantities refer to a specific population and care should be taken to consider whether marginal estimates from a trial are transportable to a wider population in which a treatment could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.4.4 Implications for observational studies\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to deciding whether or not a variable is a confounder for an exposure’s effect on an outcome is to compare its estimated effect before and after adjustment for the potential confounder. The above results show that when using logistic regression, we should be aware that a change could be attributable purely to the non-collapsibility of odds ratios. To determine whether this is the case, we could assess the association between exposure and the potential confounder. If they are independent, any difference between the marginal and conditional odds ratio for treatment could be attributable to non-collapsibility. In practice, non-collapsibility may not have a big impact on estimates. This is true when a binary outcome is rare, because then the odds ratio approximates a risk ratio, which is collapsible.\n"
