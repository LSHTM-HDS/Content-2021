    "Consider the hypothetical situation in the bottom half of Figure \\ref{prob_vs_inference}, which depicts the situation where we know the prevalence of disease in a population. If we then draw a random sample of individuals from this population, we can use \\emph{probability theory} to calculate the probability that a particular number $x$ of these individuals have the disease. So probability theory is used to describe the uncertainty about how many diseased individuals we will obtain in our sample. Here we are assuming that characteristics (called parameters) of the population, such as the population prevalence, are known.\n",

Throughout medical studies, we observe a sample of individuals from a population whose parameters are unknown and we use statistical inference to make statements about the larger population from which this sample was drawn (the upper half of Figure \\ref{prob_vs_inference}). It turns out that probability theory is also needed in this situation, which is referred to as \\emph{inference}, i.e. how to make statements about the unknown population based on an observed sample. Here probability theory is being used to quantify our uncertainty about population parameters, given the data we have observed.\n"
