    "The p-value is defined as the probability of observing the sample estimate or a more extreme one (in either direction) given that the null hypothesis is true. \n",

    "The smaller the p-value, the lower the chance of getting a difference as big  as the one observed if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the smaller the p-value,  the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",

Occasionally, a *one-sided test* might be used, where the p-value is the probability of results that are as extreme, or more extreme, *in the same direction* as the observed result. However, it is rare that it is justifiable to ignore sample statistics in one direction, so we will focus on two-sided tests.\n",
