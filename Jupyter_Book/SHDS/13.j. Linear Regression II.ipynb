    "We have seen that when $X_1$ is continuous and $X_2$ is binary, the interaction term is interpretable as the difference in slopes ($Y$ on $X_1$) between two groups defined by the binary variable $X_2$. When both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are continuous, the interaction term is interpretable as the difference in slopes ($Y$ on $X_1$) per unit increase in $X_2$.\n",
