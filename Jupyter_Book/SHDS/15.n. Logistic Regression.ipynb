    "\n",
    "In this section, we present some useful extensions of the logistic regression model. We will not go into much details and only the general idea is introduced for each. If you want more informations on extension to logistic regression, Chapter 7, 8 and 11 of the following book are useful to read.\n",

    "### 15.14.1 Conditional logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional logistic regression is specifically designed for grouped data and in particular for matched studies where each group is a pair of two matched subjetcs. Matched studies are widely used and these can be analysed using conditional logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naÃ¯ve idea would be to include into a logistic regression model a parameter specific to each data stratum. However, for matched studies, it would mean having as many parameters as pairs. This raised two main issues. First, each of this stratum specific parameter would be estimated only from the information contained in a unique pair, i.e. very few information. Secondly, as the number of pairs increases, the number of parameters would also increase and maximum likelihood theory would fail to provide valid estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of conditional logistic regression is to remove the dependence upon the stratum specific parameters by conditioning the probability on sufficient exposure informations. This way, because the stratum specific parameters vanishes from the equation, there is no violation of maximum likelihood theory assumptions and the other model parameters can be estimated consistently using classic techniques.\n",

    "### 15.14.2 Multinomial logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The multinomial logistic regression model is a generalization of the logistic regression model for outcomes that have more than $2$ categories, $Y\\in\\{1,\\dots,J\\}$ with $J\\geq 2$ a natural number. In this case, the conditional distribution of $Y_i$ given the covariates $X_i$ is the multinomial distribution. Among the $J$ categories, a reference one is chosen, e.g. the first category, and for $j=2,\\dots,J$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log\\left( \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(Y_i=j|X_i)}{\\mathbb{P}(Y_i=1|X_i)} \\right) = \\beta_{0,j} + \\sum_{k=1}^p \\beta_{k,j}X_{i,k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is estimated simultaneously for all values of $j$. For a fixed $j$, the interpretation of the parameters is similar to the logistic regression model. However, note that technically, the multinomial logistic regression model is not a generalized linear model because the multinomial probability distribution does not belong to the exponential family.\n",

    "### 15.14.3 Ordinal logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinal logistic regression is designed for outcomes that have more than $2$ categories, $Y\\in\\{1,\\dots,J\\}$ with $J\\geq 2$, and whose categories have an explicit ordering. In the ordinal logistic regression, the modelled quantity is $\\mathrm{logit}(\\mathbb{P}(Y_i\\geq j|X_i))$ for $j\\geq 2$. Indeed, when $j=1$, t\n",
    "$\\mathbb{P}(Y\\geq 1)=1$ and does not need to be modelled. As the categories are ordered, a fundamental assumption made by ordinal logistic regression is that the effect of the covariates are homogenous between the different categories. Therefore, the model is written\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{logit}(\\mathbb{P}(Y_i\\geq j|X_i)) = \\beta_{0j} + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\beta_{k}X_{i,k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where only the intercept term depends upon the category. However, it is important to be careful when making this assumption and adequation of the model should be checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.14.4 Neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably have already read about artificial neural networks, a class of model widely used for data classification in machine learning. Artificial neural networks are at the heart of *deep learning* methods used to develop computer vision, speech recognition, audio recognition, etc. Actually, the basic logistic regression model happens to be a special case of artificial neural network. If you are interested in this subject and want to have more insight on the relation between these two models, you might want to read the following article.\n",
