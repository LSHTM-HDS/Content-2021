    "## 15.6 Interpretation when $X_i$ is a continuous variable\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, the $X_i$ was a binary variable and the interpretations of the odds-ratio was done by comparing the exposed to the unexposed. But when $X_i$ is continuous, the notions of exposed and unexposed becomes irrelevant. So how should we interpret $\\beta_1$ in the following model where $X_i$ is a continuous variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{logit}(\\pi_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the linear regression, the interpretation of $\\beta_1$ is linked to the increase of $1$ unit of the variable $X_i$. Indeed, we have,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y_i=1|X_i=x+1) = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x+1))}{1+\\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x+1))} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad P(Y_i=1|X_i=x) = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}{1+\\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{P(Y_i=1|X_i=x+1)}{1-P(Y_i=1|X_1=x_1)} = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x_1+1))\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{P(Y_i=1|X_i=x)}{1-P(Y_i=1|X_i=x)} = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So that, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{P(Y_i=1|X_i=x+1)}{1-P(Y_i=1|X_i=x+1)}\\bigg/ \\frac{P(Y_i=1|X_i=x)}{1-P(Y_i=1|X_i=x)} = \\exp(\\beta_1).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $\\exp(\\beta_1)$ is the odds-ratio of having $Y=1$ for an increase of $1$ of the variable $X_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.6.1 A more general case\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just studied very simplified cases of logistic regression. Let us now study the more general case with $X_{i,1},\\dots,X_{i,p}$ $p$ numeric variables and $Y_i$ a binary variable such as $Y_i|X_{i,1},\\dots,X_{i,p}$ is a Bernoulli variable of parameter $\\pi_i$, the general model is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{logit}(\\pi_i) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^p \\beta_k X_{i,k}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model can be equivalently written using the vector notation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{logit}(\\pi_i) = \\beta^{\\top}X_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta$ is the vector of parameters of size $p+1$ and where $X_i$ is a $p+1$ vector containing the constant vector $1$ followed by the variable $X_{i,1},\\dots,X_{i,p}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation is actually quite similar to the one we made in the simplified example. We have an estimated vector of parameters $\\hat{\\beta}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\exp(\\beta_0)/(1+\\exp(\\beta_0))$ is the probability of $Y=1$ when all covariates $X_{i,k}$ are equal to $0$. If the study cohort is a random sample from the underlying population of interest, then the estimate of $\\exp(\\beta_0)/(1+\\exp(\\beta_0))$ from the data provides an estimate of the prevalence of the outcome $Y=1$ in the underlying population of interest. This is not the case if the study cohort is not a random sample, for example if it is a stratified random sample, a convenience sample, or a case-control sample. The sampling design for the study needs to be taken into account when interpreting the intercept parameter $\\beta_0$ (and functions thereof). Note however, that contrarily to before where we had only one binary covariate defining an exposed group and a unexposed group, this time, because all $X_{i,k}$ can be numeric, we have to be more specific. In particular, the group of subjects whose covariates $X_{i,k}$ are all equal to $0$ might not have any sense at all in the practice, e.g. when we include weight as a covariate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us focus on the $\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p$. Similar to the previous section, interpreting a $\\beta_k$ parameter is linked to the increase of $1$ unit of the variable $X_{i,k}$ while assuming that all other variables $(X_{i,k'})_{k'\\neq k}$ remain unchanged. Therefore, $\\exp(\\beta_k)$ is the odds-ratio for an increase of $1$ unit of $X_{i,k}$ assuming all other variables remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example we write here the odds-ratio of dementia in subjects with $X_{i,1} = x_1+1$ versus those with $X_{i,1}=x_1$ and with $X_{i,j}=x_j$ for all $1<j\\leq p$:\n",
