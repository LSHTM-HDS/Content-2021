    "Statistics for Health Data Science is the scientific approach behind investigating health. The organisers of this module have been specific in the wording. Of course, we will learn techniques to interogate data using statistics! But also, the focus on the approach is to think about a problem scientifically, for example to consider a research question, or a hypothesis. The scientific approach is important, and is described in more detail in this Introduction and the associated lecture. The scientific inquiry is applied to health data, which can take a number of forms, including 'found data'. We think this is what makes data science for health unique; found data presents great advantages as there may be a lot of found data avaialble, but also challenges as the origin of the data and the potential for biases in the data can make analysis more challenging.

    "By engaging with module you will acquire skills that a data scientist will need to interogate data to answer a health related question. Much of the focus is on the statistical tools that are most often used, as shown above in the *Intended Learning Objectives*. The module is designed towards using statistics within a problem solving cycle (more in Section 1.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this book to be a *practical guide* in using statistics. Every session provides some statistical theory and examples so you can see the theory in action. Especially in the earlier sessions, some of the examples can be done without using a computer. As the module progresses many of the calculations are carried out using R, and we will increasingly apply the concepts to real data. We provide the code for each example.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the sessions, your ability to use statistics in health data science should improve. We will begin with relatively simple questions that we want to answer. As the module progresses, the questions will be more relevant to a health, and the steps involved will require more statistical inference and scientific inquiry."

    "## 1.3 The Data Science Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a health related question is posed, this could be the start of a Data Science Project. Typically, we try to frame the question around a scientific hypothesis, identify some data that can be used to address this question/hypothesis, carry out some anlaysis and draw a conclusion. In David Spiegelhalter's Book *The Art of Statistics* this process is referred to as the PPDAC cycle (fig. 1.1). If doing data science is new to you, this might be considered a linear process. But, in many circumstances the problem solving process is a cycle, where a problem may be solved using a iterative process. The iterative process doesn't mean that the first attempt was *wrong*, but instead this iterative way of thinking enables the data scientist to think critically about each stage of the cycle and identify strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are many ways to describe the cycle of a Data Science Project, and more examples are given in the lecture by Prof. Nick Jewell. Some might chime with you more (or less) than the PPDAC presented here."

    "### 1.3.1 Identify the problem and generate a hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically Health Data Science projects start with a question. These questions are typically of three types: descriptive, comparative and relational. When developing a Data Science Project there is a need to create a question that is answerable within the timeframe available, and sufficiently precise. It is also preferbale to frame a question around a hypothesis that can be a testable prediction, and this is where statistics can be used, because a lot of statistics are framed using a hypothesis (this is especialy true of frequentist statistics). However, it is not always necessary to have a hypothesis, for example if the question is exploratory. "

    "\n",
    "The plan to answer the question/hypothesis will involve some data. For data science it is likely that the data has not been collected specifically for the purposes of answering the question. Examples may include surveillance data for infectious diseases (eg. self-reported cases of influenza-like illness to a public website) or internet searches for \"sore throat\". In this case, it is important to recognise specific attributes of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where did the data come from? What is its provenance?\n",
    "* How and why was the data collected?\n",
    "* What kind of individuals provided data, and why were they selected?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are important questions because they relate to the principles of *statistical inference*, which is covered in sessions 4-10. Central to using data to draw a conclusion is that your *sample* data is representive of the *population*. Consequently, we can carry out an analysis on the data and make statements about the wider population. This is covered in more detail in session 4 (*Populations and Samples*).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage it is important to identify the \"outcome\" variable and the \"explanatory variables\" present in the dataset, and whether we know already that some explanatory variables are associated with the outcome variable. It is also a good idea to idenitfy what type of data each variable corresponds to: continuous, ordinal, categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of the dataset is also important, as this helps us understand the structure of the data, and a framework for analyses on the data. Commonly encountered designs are (note that these are also covered in the *Epidemiology for Health Data Science* module):\n",

    "* A cohort design\n",
    "* An outcome-based design\n",

Additionally, *collider bias* may result in inappropriate conclusions being made on the effect of explanaotry variables on the outcome.\n",

    "Exploratory data anlaysis, and especially **plotting your data** is a really important part of the Data Science Project. As you progress through the module, this will become more and more familiar. Plotting your data is important to *sense check* the data and identify any errors, outliers or omissions (this is especially important with found data). Further to this, many statistical anlaysis benefit from plotting the results, for example by plotting the residuals of a linear model against the outcome to check that the model is correctly specified. Often, suitable plots may carry with them *parameter estimates* from the data, for example the mean number of influenza-like illnesses reported per week when the data are available daily.\n",

The conclusion then needs to consider the statistical result *in the context of the other considerations*, such as wanting to make inference about the population from the sample of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say the influenza-like illness data from the internet reported 40 cases per 100,000 of the population from November to January. Reporting symptoms might be skewed towards people who regularly use the internet, which might exclude elderly individuals. Consequently, this mean estimate may be an under-estimate of the population incidence due to selection bias.  "

    "## 1.6 Why we teach both frequentist and Bayesian statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "A majority of the module covers statistical inference from the *frequentist* perspective. Much of frequentist statistical inference was developed by Ronald Fisher, who has been described as the founder of modern statistics, and much of his focus was on experimental design in agriculture. A simple explanation of the philosophy behind frequentist statistics is that a *fact* is either true or not true, and data can be used to assess which of these outcomes can be accepted. In contrast, Bayesian statistics suggests that a probability can be assigned to whether the fact is true. The field of Bayesian statistics is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, who developed the theory almost 200 years before Fisher was alive. In addition, frequentist statistics makes use of the data available, and there is little (or any) ability to incorporate additional knowledge. Within a Bayesian framework, inclusion of prior knowledge is inherent, and this prior knowledge can be combined with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some argue that the philosophies are diametrically opposed to each other, and statisticians should choose a side. This is a strong view (and perhaps not the majority view?), but first it is important to understand the principles behind each approach. We have opted to teach both because of this reason, and leave it up to you to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Ultimately, both have data central to the approach in making statistical inference, so it is likely that both should be considered as perspectives in a Data Science Project."
