    "### 2.1.2 Uses of Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem has important and powerful applications in medical statistics. One common use, particularly relevant for us, is in the area of assessing the accuracy of screening tests and prognostic scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Screening tests are tests that attempt to identify people with a particular condition or disease of interest. Babies are often screened for cystic fibrosis at birth, for example. Sometimes, screening tests attempt to identify high risk people rather than those who already have the condition of interest. Cervical screening, for example, which is offered to all women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64 in the UK by the National Health Service, is a test to help prevent cancer. It doesn't look for existing cancer, but instead looks for certain viruses which can increase the subsequent risk of cancer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Screening tests can be based on one genetic marker, as in our example below, or many. Or they might incorporate information from other sources (e.g. biomarkers, family history of the disease). Screening tests typically result in a binary classification of \"positive\" or \"negative\". "

Of those who develop the cancer ($C$), 1 in 4 carry a genetic marker, $M$, whereas of those who don't develop the cancer, 1 in 10 carry $M$.  A newly born infant is tested for the genetic marker and is found to carry it. What is the probability that this infant will develop cancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first couple of sentences tell us that $P(C) = 0.1$, $P(M|C) = 0.25$  and $P(M | \\bar{C})=0.1.$ Our interest lies in $P(C|M)$. So we wish to reverse the conditioning. We can obtain this by applying Bayes' Theorem:\n",

    "More generally, suppose we have a procedure that results in a binary classification (a binary prediction). This might be a screening test, which could be based on one or more genetic markers or biomarkers. It could be based on the output from a  prognostic risk score or a label derived from an algorithm. Whatever the procedure, suppose we end up with a binary classification: \"Positive\" or \"Negative\". In the health context, this terminology (positive/negative) might represent pairs such as: \"Diseased\" and \"Undiseased\"; \"Dead\" and \"Alive\" or \"Hospitalised\" and \"Not hospitalised\". We can contrast the binary classification with the (binary) true status. In the general discussion below, we will also use the terms positive and negative to denote the two possible true statuses. \n",
