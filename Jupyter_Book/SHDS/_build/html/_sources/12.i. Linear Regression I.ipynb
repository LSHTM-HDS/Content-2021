    "Confidence intervals give us more information than the estimated regression coefficient, because they take into account the uncertainty in our estimates. Confidence intervals are constructed in such a way so that they will contain the true population parameter a specified proportion of the time, typically 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that a formal interpretation of the 95% confidence interval is as follows: if the analysis was repeated 100 times and 95% confidence intervals were obtained each time, then 95% of those confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter. More informally, confidence intervals are often interpreted as a range of plausible values for the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of a  95% confidence interval for the parameter $\\hat{\\beta}_1$  is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\pm t_{0.025, n-2} SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)\n",

    "If 0 lies in the confidence interval, we would conclude that the independent variable and outcome are not associated, because it is plausible that $\\beta1=0$. If 0 does not lie within the confidence interval, then there is evidence of an association.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if $n$ is sufficiently large, the t-distribution is well approximated by a normal distribution. In this case, a 95% confidence interval can be found by:\n",
