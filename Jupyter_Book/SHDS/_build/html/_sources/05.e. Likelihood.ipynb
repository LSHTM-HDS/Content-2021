    "# 5.4 Finding the MLE\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have obtained the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) by plotting the likelihood for different parameter values and looking for the value which yields the maximum. Of course, the estimate obtained in this way depends on how many parameter values we evaluate. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more formal way is to determine the location of that maximal point algebraically, from the likelihood function itself. In this way, we can directly obtain the general form for the MLE in terms of the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the log-likelihood comes into its own; we know that a value which maximises the log-likelihood also maximises the likelihood, and the impact of logs on products and powers make the algebra much simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find the maximum likelihood estimator of a parameter from the log-likelihood function through the following steps:\n",
