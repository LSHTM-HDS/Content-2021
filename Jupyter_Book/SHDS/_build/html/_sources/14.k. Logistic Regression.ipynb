    "## 14.10 Diagnosis for the logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a regression model, and in particular a logistic regression model, it is important to bear in mind the goal of the study. To simplify, it can be either a predictive goal or an explanatory goal. If the goal is to have a model with very good predictive ability, we do not really care about which variables are included in the model as long as its predictive abilities are good. When selecting the model, we will prefer a model with good predictive value on external data even at the price of a lesser good fit to the initial dataset. However, let us note that there is often a correlation between a model that fits corretly the initial data and a model with good predictive ability. If the goal is explanatory, we focus on the clinical validity of the model and the interpretation of the parameters. Thus, which variables are included into the model should be carefully thought using scientific knowledge of the modelisation problem from clinician inputs. Also, when selecting the model, we will prefer a model that carefully takes into account the relation between the variables from the study data rather than a model that have good predictive ability on an external dataset. However, we expect from a good model estimated from appropriate data that similar results shall be found on an appropriate external dataset. This is a topic of major interest in science and is known as the *reproducibility of scientific research*. Finally, let us also note that the goal of a study can also be to explore the causal structure between some variables and the outcome rather than just associations. However, causality and causal inference will not be mentioned in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first see how to evaluate the explanatory abilities of a logistic regression model using goodness-of-fit tools that evaluates how close to the data the model actually is and then we will see how to evaluate the predictive abilities of a logistic regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.10.1 Goodness-of-fit\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen some concepts used to assess the goodness-of-fit of regression model: the deviance, which measures the distance between the model and the saturated model and the AIC that penalizes over-fitting. We present here two additional way of assessing the goodness-of-fit of the logistic regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.10.1.1 McFadden pseudo-$R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the linear regression model, we have studied the $R^2$ that measures how much variability is explained by the model. For the logistic regression model, several generalization of the $R^2$ measure have been proposed. Here, we will focus on the McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$. The McFadden $R^2$ is defined as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R^2_{McFadden} = 1 - \\frac{\\ell_e}{\\ell_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\ell_e$ is the log-likelihood of the estimated model and $\\ell_0$ is the log-likelihood of the null model having only an intercept. The rationale behind this measure is that, when the estimated model does not explain correctly the variability, its log-likelihood will be close to the null log-likelihood so that the ratio will be close to $1$ and the McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$ close to $0$. On the contrary, when the model correctly explains the variability of the model, the likelihood will be close to $1$ and therefore $\\ell_e$ will be close to $0$ so that the McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$ will be close to $1$. However, when applied to a classic linear regression model, the McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$ is not equivalent to the classic $R_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to compute the McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$ from `R` quite easily using the function `logLik` that extracts the value of the estimated log-likelihood for a `glm` object. If we want to compute it for our three examples, this is how we would do"

Both are equivalent and the second can be computed from the first by using the inverse of the $\\mathrm{logit}$ function as we have seen when introducing the logistic model. In `R`, the choice is made through the option `type`.

    "A perfect model should have a high sensitivity and a high specificity and its ROC curve shoud attain the top-left corner of the plot. A model without predictive ability shoud lie on the identity curve. The goal is to find a model that gets close to the top-left corner. To assess how close to the top-left corner a ROC curve is, one of the most used measure in the *area under the ROC*, often shortly referred in the literature as the *AUC* for *area under the curve*. The perfect model would have an AUC of $1$ while a poor model shall have an AUC of $0.5$, the goal is to find a model whose AUC gets close to $1$, i.e. that has high specificity and high sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we find an AUC of $0.840$ which is quite good. However, we can expect to achieve better results with a more appropriate model as the example used here remains a very simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Exercise:* Using the code you have written for computing $Se$ and $Sp$, write a code that plots the ROC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the ROC curve is a very traditional tool from the predictive toolkit but it is less and less used as it is not very informative \\emph{per se} reporting directly the numbers is preferred. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14.10.2.5 External validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, we have estimated a model on the `dementia` dataset and have studied its prediction ability on the same data. This is not a good approach in general. The issue here is that, by estimating and validating the model on the exact same dataset, we might capture pattern specific to this dataset and the predictive ability of the model might be very different on external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to tackle this issue is to use different data to estimate and validate the model in order to avoid overfitting to a particular dataset. The data used to estimate and calibrate the model is called *the learning data* and the data used to validate the prediction accuracy of the model is called the *validation data*. There are different ways of applying this idea into practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we can divide the initial dataset into two parts (not necessarily of equal size): the learning one and the validation one\n",
    "* the $k-$fold cross validation is a resampling technique that divides the initial dataset into $k$ smaller datasets. Each one of the $k$ groups will serves as a validation dataset for a model estimated on the other $k-1$ dataset. By repeating this for the $k$ small datasets separately, we obtain $k$ different predictions from which we can evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. When $k=1$, this method is known as the *leave-one-out* procedure\n",
    "* the *bootstrap* procedure is a reseampling technique that artificially creates several dataset from the same initial dataset by resampling subjects with replacement\n",
    "* use an external dataset from a different source as validation data for the model estimated from an initial dataset"
