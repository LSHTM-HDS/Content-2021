    "- If $\\sigma$ is unknown (which is typically the case), there is a modified confidence interval based on the t-distribution which provides a correct interval. Essentially, we replace the number 1.96 above by a slightly larger number to compensate for the estimation of the standard deviation. For large sample sizes ($n>30$ or so), the substitution of the estimated standard deviation makes little difference. If you are interested in the details, these can be found in the optional material for this session."
