These notes contain the key materials required for the module Statistics for Health Data Science, part of the MSc in Health Data Science at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 
 
This is a compulsory module for the programme MSc Health Data Science. The module provides an introduction to the key statistical concepts and methods for health data science. Topics covered include probability, initial data description and, exploration, statistical inference, regression, and Bayesian analysis. These topics provide the framework needed for subsequent modules. The module places a focus on learning through practical examples and incorporates directed learning, lectures, group discussion, and computer practical exercises.
