Every time we estimate something we \"use\" a bit of information (and so lose a degree of freedom. Therefore, when we calculate the overall variation in $Y$, we lose one of the $n$ bits of information because we need to calculate the overall mean to obtain the sum of squares of $Y$. Therefore, we have $n-1$ bits of information overall.  In a simple linear regression model, we estimate two parameters, so we're using two bits of information, but one of these is essentially the same bit we lost from calculating the overall mean, so we say that the regression model is using 1 degree of freedom. We started with n-1 df and the regression model used 1 of them so there are n-2 left for the remaining component, the residual SS. \n",
