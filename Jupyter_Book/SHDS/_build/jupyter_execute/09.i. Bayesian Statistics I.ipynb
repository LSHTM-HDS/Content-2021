    "In the example with the Beta-Binomial model, we found that using the Beta distribution for the prior lead us to a posterior distribution that is also a Beta distribution. This is not a coincidence. Often, a particular distributional family is chosen for the prior, so that the resulting posterior distribution belongs to the same family. This is called a conjugate prior. Below are the conjugate priors for some common likelihood models. \n",

    "Suppose that there is an experiment where $n$ patients are asked to try different treatments each time they get a headache. We are interested in the number of different treatments a patient takes before they find one that is successful. For patient $i$, for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, we denote by $y_i$ the number of treatments tried before the first success. Note that $\\left\\{ y_1, y_2, ..., y_n \\right\\}$ are a sample from a Geometric distribution: $y_i \\sim Geom(\\theta)$. The probability density function of a geometric distribution is: \n",
