    "This is the first of four sessions that explore regression modelling. In this, and the next, session we consider linear regression modelling. These are models where the outcome of interest is a continuous variable. We then extend those ideas to regression models for other variable types, such as binary (logistic regression) and count (Poisson regression)."
