    "## 13.4 Centering\n",
    "\n",
    "In many analyses, interpreting the intercept is not as important as interpreting the estimated regression coefficients and so it does not matter if our intercept is an absurd value (as in the example above). However, if we do wish to obtain a reasonable intercept, we can **center** the independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Centering means subtracting a constant from every value of the independent variable. This essentially shifts the scale of the predictor (the point 0 is shifted to the chosen constant), but does not affect the units of the variable. Consequently, the new interpretation of the intercept would be the mean of $Y$ when the independent variable is equal to the constant. The estimated regression coefficient of the independent variable is not affected. \n",
    "\n",
    "As as example, we will repeat the analysis above, but center the covariates on their mean value. "
