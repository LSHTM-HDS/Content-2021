For each parameter of interest, a **profile** likelihood is constructed, which treats all other parameters as nuisances and removes them from the likelihood (by setting to their values which maximise the likelihood for each value of the parameter of interest). Then confidence intervals are constructed based on the profile likelihood. The Wald-type confidence intervals provide an approximation to this process.

As such, it can be less accurate than the likelihood ratio test, particularly if the null value is a long way from the maximum likelihood estimate. However, in this case all tests are likely to provide small p-values and similar qualitative conclusions. \n",

    "The Wald test is used to obtain the p-values automatically displayed in regression output for GLMs in R and many other software platforms. This is because Wald tests are computationally less intensive than likelihood ratio tests.\n",

    "**Score test** These tests are based on a slightly different quadratic approximation to the log-likelihood-ratio. This type of test is much less used than the other types, so we do not pursue this further here. Early tests used in epidemiology tended to be score tests, since they are less computationally intensive than the other approaches. "
