# The notes for the Bayesian Inference sessions are heavily based on the Foundations course material created by Alex Lewin and Alexina Mason, which was previously developed by James Carpenter, Marcel Zwahlen and Beat Neuenschwander. Some sections are inspired also by notes from Michail Papathomas. We are grateful for their work and permission to re-use.
