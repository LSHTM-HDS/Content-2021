    "In statistical inference, our task is to make statements about the underlying parameter(s) of our proposed model given the observed data. In particular, we typically wish to obtain the best estimate of the unknown parameters.  We also wish to know how well we have estimated the unknown parameter(s). The concept of likelihood provides the best single framework for this task. We will see that the likelihood function, often simply called the likelihood, plays a fundamental role in both frequentist and Bayesian inference."
