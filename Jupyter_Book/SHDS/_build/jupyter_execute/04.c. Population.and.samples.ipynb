    "# 4.2 Statistical models\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract information about population quantities from sample statistics we need a precise and formal description of the whole sampling process from population to sample. This description is called the **statistical model**. Relevant features of the population are represented by parameters, such as the mean, variance, or correlation. The structure of the population, together with the sampling process, allows a model to be formulated that describes the statistical behaviour of the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial importance of the statistical model is that, given a certain value of the population parameter (in the simple case where there is only one parameter of interest), it allows us to calculate the probability of drawing a sample with the properties we observe: this will allow us to quantify the compatibility between the observed data and possible values of the population parameter.\n"

Remember that $X_1, ...,X_{10}$ are random variables representing the ages of 10 sampled researchers and $x_1, ..., x_{10}$ are the realised values of these random variables (i.e. the observed ages).  \n",
