    "## 12.17 ANOVA for multivariable linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of multivariable linear regression, ANOVA can be used to test whether a more complex model is a better fit than the null model (**the Global F test**), or whether a more complex model is a better fit than a simpler model that includes a subset of the covariates in the complex model (**the partial F test**). Each test requires slight modifications to the ANOVA table defined above and we will discuss these in turn. \n",
