    "> In this parameterisation of the model, the group defined by $C=0$ is often referred to as the baseline group. There is no statistical reason why one group rather than another should be chosen as the baseline group. It can sometimes be desirable to re-parameterise a model of this type to estimate parameters representating differences in mean levels from a particular baseline group. In this example, for instance, we might instead want the group with normal weight to be our baseline group, in which case we would need to redefine our first dummy variable. <br> <br>\n",
    "> Note that, in contrast to the models that we have met so far, this has more than one variable in it (even though the three dummy variables together measure a single characteristic). Therefore, this is no longer strictly a simple linear regression model. It is an example of a multivariable linear regression model. We will discuss general theory for this model later. Broadly speaking, the ideas we have met in the context of simple linear regression extend to this more general model very naturally."

This is important to know, since there are many variables that are categorical by definition and may be required for a statistical analysis. For example: cancer stage, ethnicity, education level, etc. While these examples should be included as a categorical variable in a linear regression model, it is not, in general, recommended to categorise a continuous variable in a linear model. We did so above, purely for pedagogical reasons.\n",
