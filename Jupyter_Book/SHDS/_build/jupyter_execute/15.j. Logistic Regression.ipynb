    "and can be estimated in `R` using the `glm` function. To include an interaction between two variables `x` and `z` into a model in `R`, we have to specify both the variable and the interaction term explicitly using the `:` symbol: `y ~Â x + z + x:z`. We can also use the symbol `*` between two variables and both the variables and the interaction term will be included: `y ~ x*z`. Both formula will estimate the exact same model. Be careful however when using `*` with more than two variables and check that you actually want to include all the interaction terms."

Thankfully, it is easy to access this matrix in `R` when estimating the model with the `glm` function. The function `vcov` which takes as argument a `glm` object will give the display the estimated covariance matrix. For example, we can compute the estimated covariate matrix for the third model `dementia3`. There is however no direct way to obtain the CI using the raw `R` output of the `glm` function.\n"
