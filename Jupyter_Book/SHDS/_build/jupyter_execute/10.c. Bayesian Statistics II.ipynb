    "### 10.2.2 Prior \n",

    "To derive the posterior for the mean $\\mu$, we need to find the  distribution of that parameter conditional on the data (both the empirical data and prior distribution). In the following calculation, we are only interested in the parts of the p.d.f. that depend on $\\mu$. Any terms not involving $\\mu$ are part of the *normalisation constant*. This is part of the p.d.f., but does not affect the shape of the density. \n",

    "1. the Normal prior is *conjugate* for a Normal Likelihood, as the posterior is also Normal. \n",
    "2. The posterior mean, $\\frac{ \\tau^2 n\\bar{y} + \\sigma^2\\phi }{\\tau^2 n + \\sigma^2}$ is a weighted average of the data $\\bar y $ and the prior mean $\\phi$: we can write it as $w \\bar{y} + (1-w) \\phi$, where $w= \\frac{\\tau^2 n}{\\tau^2 n + \\sigma^2}$ . Hence the posterior combines the information from the likelihood (data) and prior (a priori belief).    \n",
    "3. The variance of the posterior is  $\\frac{\\sigma^2\\tau^2}{\\tau^2n+\\sigma^2}$. In a larger study, since $n$ becomes very large, we have $\\tau^2 >> \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$, so the posterior variance tends to zero.\n",
    "4. In smaller studies, $\\tau^2 << \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$, the posterior mean is closer to $\\phi$ and the posterior variance depends both on the prior and sampling variance $\\frac{\\sigma^2\\tau^2}{\\tau^2n+\\sigma^2}$. "
