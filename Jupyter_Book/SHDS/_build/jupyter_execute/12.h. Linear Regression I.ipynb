    "1. The null hypothesis is $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$. The test statistic (from the R output) is $T=-8.72$. We can check this is the ratio of the estimated slope to its standard error (-9.2661/1.0628 = -8.72). The p-value is $p<2e_16$. In health applications, we typically write $p<0.001$. We interpret this as strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude there is an association between birthweight and maternal smoking. \n",
