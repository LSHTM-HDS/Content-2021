    "Based on the above results, we would predict that a baby whose mother was 66 inches tall and whose pregancy lasted 200 days would weigh somewhere between 81.30 and 91.03 ounces. Additionally, we estimate that 95\\% of babies whose mother was 66 inches tall and whose pregancy lasted 200 days would weigh between 53.55 and 118.79 ounces. \n",

    "### 14.7.3 Causal inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, suppose our aim was to estimate the causal effect of length of pregnancy on birthweight. As is shown in the DAG, we assumed that mother's height was a common cause of length of pregnancy and birthweight and therefore needed to adjust for it in the analysis to remove confounding bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the output above, we would report $\\hat{\\beta_1}=0.45$ and the 95\\% confidence interval: (0.39, 0.51). Based on these results, we can conclude that length of pregnancy does have a causal effect on birthweight (since 0 does not lie within the confidence interval). However, the validity of these findings rely on the assumption that there are **no unmeasured variables causing confounding bias** (which is a very strong assumption and can be difficult to justify).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that we cannot interpret $\\hat{\\beta_2}$ in the same way as $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ in this analysis. We interpreted $\\beta_1$ causally, because mother's height was the only confounding variable in the association between length of pregnancy and birthweight, and we controlled for it in the analysis. However, length of pregnancy is not a confounding variable for the association between mother's height and birthweight. In fact, length of pregnancy lies on the causal pathway between mother's height and birthweight, which means that some of the effect of mother's height on birthweight can be explained through the length of pregnancy. According to our DAG, the **total effect** of mother's height on birthweight comprises of two parts: (1) the **direct effect** (denoted by the path between height and birthweight) and (2) the **indirect effect** (denoted by the causal pathway that runs through length of pregnancy). Since we have adjusted for length of pregnancy in our analysis, we have controlled for the indirect effect of mother's height on birthweight and therefore $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ represents the direct effect only. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common mistake in medical research to interpret all the estimated regression coefficients from a multivariable model in the same way, but as our example has shown, this can be misleading. This problem is known in the literature as the **Table 2 fallacy**. \n"
